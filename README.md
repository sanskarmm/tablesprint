```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd tablesprint
```

### 3️⃣ Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables:
In the root of the project, create a `.env` file and add the following variables:
```env
PORT=5000
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USERNAME=your-mysql-username
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-mysql-password
MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME=your-mysql-database-name
```
> **Note:** Replace `your-*` placeholders with your actual values.

### 4️⃣ Install dependencies:
Run the following command to install the necessary packages for both frontend and backend:

## Usage
### **Register a User**
To register a user, you can either use Postman or ThunderClient (VS Code Extension) to send a `POST` request to:
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/user/register
```
#### **Example User JSON:**
```json
{
  "name": "john doe",
  "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
  "password": "12345678",
  "confirmPassword": "12345678"
}
```
Alternatively, you can manually insert the user into the MySQL database. Here's how you can generate a hashed password using Node.js:
```js
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const password = "12345678";
const hashedPassword = bcrypt.hashSync(password, 10);
console.log(hashedPassword);
```
Once you generate the hashed password, insert the user into your database:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password)
VALUES ('john doe', 'johndoe@gmail.com', 'hashed_password_here');
```

### **Login**
1. After successfully registering, navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.
2. Enter your registered email and password.
3. Click the **Login** button.

### **Dashboard**
Once logged in, you will be redirected to the dashboard, where you can perform actions on products, categories, and subcategories:
- ➕ **Add Items**: Use the `Add Category`, `Add Subcategory`, and `Add Product` buttons in their respective sections.
- ✏️ **Edit/Delete Items**: Modify or remove items by clicking on the edit or delete icons in the action column.
